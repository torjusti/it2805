      <p>My name is Torjus Tønnessen Iveland. My field of study is informatics.</p>
      <p>I have programmed before, mainly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and some tools/frameworks in these languages, such as SASS for styling.</p>
      <p>I expect that this course will make me spend more time furthering my programming and web development skills. Building web sites is fun, and something I am really looking forward to.</p>
